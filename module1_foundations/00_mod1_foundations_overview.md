# Readings:
* _Introduction to Statistical Learning_: Chapter 1
* _Introduction to Statistical Learning_: Chapter 2

# Goals
* Understand classification vs. regression
* Understand the Bias-Variance Tradeoff (seriously, this will come up again and again.  It's a cornerstone in ML)
* Be able to run python and jupyter

## Things to Think About:
* When might a less accurate model that is more easily understood be more appropriate?
* What is overfitting?  Are we more likely to overfit our data with a more complex and less easily understood model?
* What's the relationship between the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, and model generalizability?
* What does it mean for a machine to learn?
* When can we think of $f$ as a black box and when might we need to understand it?
